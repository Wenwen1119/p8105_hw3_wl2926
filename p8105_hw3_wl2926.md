### Filter data for the “Overall Health” topic and “Poor” to “Excellent” responses.

``` r
response_range <- c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent")
#filter for "Overall Health" topic and responses from "Excellent" to "Poor"
overallhealth_data <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health" & response %in% response_range)

#organize responses as a factor with levels ordered from "Poor" to "Excellent"
overallhealth_data$response <- factor(overallhealth_data$response, 
                                      levels = response_range)
```

### Question 1: States observed at 7 or more locations in 2002 and 2010

``` r
states_2002 <- overallhealth_data %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>%
  summarise(num_locations = n()) %>%
  filter(num_locations >= 7) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
states_2002
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 3
    ## # Groups:   locationabbr [0]
    ## # ℹ 3 variables: locationabbr <chr>, locationdesc <chr>, num_locations <int>

``` r
states_2010 <- overallhealth_data %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>%
  summarise(num_locations = n()) %>%
  filter(num_locations >= 7)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
states_2010
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 3
    ## # Groups:   locationabbr [0]
    ## # ℹ 3 variables: locationabbr <chr>, locationdesc <chr>, num_locations <int>

In the year 2002, none of the states were observed in 7 or more
locations. The same case applies to the year 2010.  
\### Question 2: Subset a dataset for “Excellent” responses and make a
spaghetti plot.

``` r
excellent_data <- overallhealth_data %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarise(avg_data_value = mean(data_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
#spaghetti plot
ggplot(excellent_data, aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, 
                           group = locationabbr, 
                           color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line(size=1.5) +
  labs(title = "Mean data value for Excellent\n responses over time by State",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Mean data value",
       color="State") +

There appears to be a generally decreasing trend over time for the
average data value for “Excellent” responses in the “Overall health”
topic.

### Question 3: Two-panel plot showing the distribution of “data_value” for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State for 2006 and 2010

``` r
ny_data <- overallhealth_data %>%
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & year %in% c(2006, 2010))

#two-panel plot
ggplot(ny_data, aes(x = data_value, fill = response)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, position = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of data value for responses (Poor to Excellent) in NY",
       x = "Data value",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Response") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_wl2926_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

For NY, the year 2010 had a larger count of observations compared to the
year 2006 in this subset. This included for observations under both the
“Poor” and “Fair” responses on the overall health topic.  
For the year 2010, data values for the various responses were more
consistent compared to the year 2006.

## Problem 3.

nhanes_accel <- read.csv("nhanes_accel.csv")
#display the structure of the dataset
dim(nhanes_accel)
```

nhanes_covar <- read.csv("nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4)
nhanes_covar <- na.omit(nhanes_covar)

  filter(age >= 21)
#view dimensions of merged data

    ## [1]  228 1445

``` r

nhanes_data$sex <- factor(nhanes_data$sex, 
                               levels = c(1, 2), 
                               labels = c("male", 
                                          "female"))
nhanes_data$education <- factor(nhanes_data$education, 
                               levels = c(1, 2, 3), 
                               labels = c("Less than high school", 
                                          "High school equivalent", 
                                          "More than high school"))
```

### Question 1: Table for the number of men and women in each education category.

``` r
edu_sex_data <- nhanes_data %>%
  group_by(education, sex) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
edu_sex_data_wide <- edu_sex_data %>% #convert table to wide format
  spread(key = sex, value = count)
kable(edu_sex_data_wide, 
      caption = "Number of Men and Women in each education category")
```

| education              | male | female |
|:-----------------------|-----:|-------:|
| Less than high school  |   27 |     28 |
| High school equivalent |   35 |     23 |
| More than high school  |   56 |     59 |

Number of Men and Women in each education category

Female participants were the leading observations for the
*`Less than high school`*and *`More than high school`*, whereas male
participants led in the *`High school equivalent`* education
categories.From the table, it is evident that the male participants had
the larger proportion of observations in the dataset due to its having
the larger difference in distribution for the *`High school equivalent`*
education category on comparison with the differences in the other
categories.

### Question 2: Create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category.

``` r
ggplot(nhanes_data, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = factor(sex))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age distributions by education and sex",
       x = "Education",
       y = "Age",
       fill = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_wl2926_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

The age distribution of the participants whose education category was
`Less than high school` shows left-skewed distributions for both sexes,
as indicated by the median line of their respective box plots, which
implies larger numbers of older individuals compared to the younger
ones. The males in this category also had a larger range, while the
females had a slightly higher median value.  
For both sexes of the participants whose education category was
`High school equivalent`, their age values indicate left-skewed
distributions, implying larger numbers of older individuals compared to
the younger ones. The median age value of the females was larger
compared to that of male participants. Again, their the male
participants were comparatively younger to their female counterparts,
even though they had the larger number of observations as well as a
wider range of age values.  
Lastly, for the participants whose education category was
`More than high school`, the median values indicate right-skewed
distributions, implying larger numbers of younger individuals compared
to that of the older ones. The male median age value is larger than that
of female participants as well as the range of values.

### Question 3: Aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot total activities against age, comparing men to women and having separate panels for each education level

``` r
#aggregate by sum foreach participant
nhanes_data$total_activity <- rowSums(nhanes_data[, 2:1441], na.rm = TRUE)

#Plot total activities against age by gender and education
ggplot(nhanes_data, aes(x = age, y = total_activity,color = factor(sex))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  labs(title = "Total activity vs. age by gender and education",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Total activity",
       color = "Gender")+
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_wl2926_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

This plot compares the total activities against age for men and women,
with separate panels for each education level. For the
`Less than high school` education category, the trend lines show younger
females as more active compared to younger males. At about 45 years of
age, their total activities were about equal, and males were more active
thereafter. For the other education categories, females show more
activeness compared to males. Across all the education and sex
categories, the general trend is that the total activity declines over
age. The rate of decline of the total activity is highest for the
`Less than high school`, and least for the `More than high school`.

### Question 4: Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex.

``` r
#subset columns 2 to 1441, which represent the minutes of the day
minutes_data <- nhanes_data[, 2:1441]

#create a new data frame with hourly activity aggregates
hourly_data <- data.frame(sex = nhanes_data$sex, 
                          education = nhanes_data$education)
#loop through the columns and aggregate every 60 columns=1 hour
hour_labels <- sprintf("hour_%d", 1:24)  #hour labels
for (i in seq(1, ncol(minutes_data), 60)) {
  #calculate the activity sum for each hour, add to the new data frame
  hourly_data[hour_labels[i %/% 60 + 1]] <- 
    rowSums(minutes_data[, i:(i + 59)], na.rm = TRUE)}
#print the first few rows of the new data frame
str(hourly_data)
```
